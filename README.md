# ChangeUpSimulation

This is a simulation of the 2020-2021 Vex game Change Up.
In order to build this project, you need gnu make, which you should have if you have pros. You'll also need java obviously.
To build it, just use the command: make.
To run it, either start the jar file from the command line, or use the command: make run.

Controls:

Right now you can control the lower blue robot and the lower red robot with the arrow keys and wasd respectively. You can also collect/descore a ball with PgUp and Q, and you can eject/score a ball with PgDn and E.
