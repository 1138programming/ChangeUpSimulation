# ChangeUpSimulation

This is a simulation of the 2020-2021 Vex game Change Up.
In order to build this project, you need gnu make, which you should have if you have pros. You'll also need java obviously. To build it, just use the command: make. To run it, either double click on the jar file, or start the jar file from the command line. You can also use the command: make run. I haven't packaged the images used in the simulation in with the jar file yet, so in order for it to render properly, you need to make sure the jar file stays in the same directory as the resources folder.

Controls:

Right now you can control the lower blue robot and the lower red robot with the arrow keys and wasd respectively. You can also collect/descore a ball with PgUp and Q, and you can eject/score a ball with PgDn and E.
